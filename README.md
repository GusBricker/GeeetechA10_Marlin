# Geeetech A10 Marlin 2.0.x (2020 version)

This branch has been forked directly from Marlin 2.0.x branch, with the only changes existing between `Configuration.h` and `Configuration_adv.h`.

The firmware is configured for a printer with the following modifications:
- BLTouch
- TMC2209 on X,Y,Z (wired in legacy mode - aka dropped into the GT2560v4 board)
- BMG Clone Extruder

Other nice things:
- Software PWM has been enabled for the cooling fan so it can work between 0-100% (mine seems to start to spin above 40%)
- Action commands enabled for nice Octoprint integration
- Filament runout sensor enabled
- Z Offset setup wizard in this version of Marlin is *amazing*
- Linear advance has been setup for Capricorn Bowden setup
- Z safe homing enabled to prevent BLTouch damage
- Slightly reduced X bed size (220mm->214mm) to prevent print head connector crashing into frame
- Slightly reduced Z height (260mm->250mm) to prevent wires and bowden tube getting crushed by top of frame
- Also added helper script for programming GT2560v4 board on Mac OS because I find programming often fails mid write via Arduino Studio which causes the entire environment to crash. Once it has crashed, Arduino Studio has to recompile the entire project from scratch adding signifigant time to test changes.

Please test this firmware and let us know if it misbehaves in any way. Volunteers are standing by!

## Marlin 2.0

Marlin 2.0 takes this popular RepRap firmware to the next level by adding support for much faster 32-bit and ARM-based boards while improving support for 8-bit AVR boards. Read about Marlin's decision to use a "Hardware Abstraction Layer" below.

Download earlier versions of Marlin on the [Releases page](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin/releases).

## Building Marlin 2.0

To build Marlin 2.0 you'll need [Arduino IDE 1.8.8 or newer](https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software) or [PlatformIO](http://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/ide.html#platformio-ide). Detailed build and install instructions are posted at:

  - [Installing Marlin (Arduino)](http://marlinfw.org/docs/basics/install_arduino.html)
  - [Installing Marlin (VSCode)](http://marlinfw.org/docs/basics/install_platformio_vscode.html).

## License

Marlin is published under the [GPL license](/LICENSE) because we believe in open development. The GPL comes with both rights and obligations. Whether you use Marlin firmware as the driver for your open or closed-source product, you must keep Marlin open, and you must provide your compatible Marlin source code to end users upon request. The most straightforward way to comply with the Marlin license is to make a fork of Marlin on Github, perform your modifications, and direct users to your modified fork.

While we can't prevent the use of this code in products (3D printers, CNC, etc.) that are closed source or crippled by a patent, we would prefer that you choose another firmware or, better yet, make your own.
